### Exercise files for the [FCC Crash Course Svelte YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhGiGqZ78Rs)

Learn Svelte in this full tutorial for beginners. You will build your first Svelte app that uses multiple routes, handles forms and consumes a full CRUD API.

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. It is a framework that really isn't a framework. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.
